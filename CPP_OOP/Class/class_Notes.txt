By default, all class members have private access – so any members that appear in the class
declaration without an access specifier will have private access.

class ClassName
{
access specifier :
member1 ;
member2 ;
access specifier :
member3 ;
member4 ;
} ;

• Public members are accessible from any place where the class is visible
• Private members are accessible only to other members of the same class
• Protected members are accessible only to other members of the same class and to
members of classes derived from that class
